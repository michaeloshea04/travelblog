                      <p>We are standing on the Swing Bridge with the Tyne bridge in the background.</p>

                      <p>We overlooked these bridges from our hotel room.  It was a brilliant sunny day in Newcastle.</p>

                      <p> Rory wanted his photo taken on the tiles.  He's a strange kid sometimes.</p>

                      <p>Rory is trying on old knight's helmet.  Which he promptly took off when I warned him he might get nits.</p>
